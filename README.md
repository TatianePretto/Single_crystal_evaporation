In this work, we have used a wealth of data collected during MAPbBr3 single crystal growth, using an FRC with PID control system, to predict the evaporation rate using machine learning models to optimize the control of the crystal growth process. The data was divided into three-time intervals: 1 to 10 hours, 10 to 20 hours, and from 20 hours to the end of growth, and we developed one model per database. Three supervised learning algorithms were tested – Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost – to identify the most suitable model. From these algorithms, XGBoost presented a combo of performance and running time, and we selected it to predict the evaporation rates. Using feature importance by permutation and SHAP values, we could understand that during the growth, the features gained different weights. Humidity, for example, became more important in the last stages of crystal growth. We applied the machine learning models to new MAPbBr3 growths and compared them with the previous results. With the evaporation rate predictions updated every 30 minutes during the growth, we achieved an even better growth rate control than in the non-predictions previous system.
