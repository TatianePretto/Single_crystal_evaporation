Precise control over crystallization parameters remains a significant challenge in solution crystal growth systems, where the evaporation rate has a significant role in producing highly reproducible crystals. This study applies machine learning (ML) models to predict the evaporation rate to optimize the control of the crystal growth process. Three supervised learning algorithms – Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost – are evaluated to identify the most suitable model. From these algorithms, XGBoost presents a combo of performance and running time, and it is used to predict the evaporation rates.  Using XGBoost-based ML, high-quality MAPbBr3 single crystals are grown, exhibiting an average full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.2 ± 0.02 arcsec in the X-ray rocking curve measurements. These MAPbBr3 crystals are further used as absorber materials in the fabrication of reproducible X-ray detectors, achieving an average sensitivity of 4,500 ± 500 μC Gyair-1 cm-2 at an electric field of 100 V cm-1, with the lowest detection limit of 55 nGyair s-1.
